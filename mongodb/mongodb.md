# MongoDB

## What is MongoDB?
* Database!
  * Used for storing persistent data in an application.
* Separated from the wide, wide, world wide web with a web server
  * In my own case, I'll be using NodeJS, but Ruby, Python, etc. all can also work
  * Where user permissions and similar security features live
* Mongoose is an **ORM or Object-Relational Mapping** Tool 
  * converts data between the NodeJS server and MongoDB

## MongoDB Data Storage
### Two Ideas!
First! We can have multiple internal databases inside of a single mongo instance

Second! We have **collections!**
* Core unit of what stores data inside a Mongo Database
* Store different types of data in these collections
* No mixing and matching!

## Core Mongoose/Mongo Operators
* Cread
* Read
* Update
* Destroy
