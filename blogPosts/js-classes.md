# What Me and JavaScript Have in Common...

So a bit about me. I wear New Balance and unironically listen to Pop Punk and always wear hoodies and cargo shorts and burp loudly and my parents thought a Cotillion would have been wasted on me.

All those things make me feel a close kinship with JavaScript. Why?

We can pretend (badly) that we have it, but neither of us have class!

Get it....?

I started my development journey trying to learn Python and I stopped when it got to OOP. I still struggle to understand that. That's not a dig against OOP, I just struggle to wrap my brain around it.

Fast forward to picking up JavaScript.

I went through Tony Alicea's JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts and got to objects and really understood what he was laying down.

Object.create, etc.

That made so much sense to me. It was so simple.

So if "prototypal inheritance" or "behavioral delegation" as Kyle Simpson refers to it is so easy, why is the "new" and "class" keyword so prevelant?

Because they're in all the other popular languages! And they were in Java when Java was top dog and JavaScript had just been born.

But history aside, look at the top languages. Java, PHP, C++, Python. They all use classical inheritance!

JavaScript (and TypeScript) are the odd men out!

And if you've ever been the kid who didn't fit in, what did you try to do? If you were anything like me, you tried to fit in. You faked comformity. And it sucked. Like it didn't feel great or authentic.

But if you're trying to be something you're not, you're gonna suck at that more than the people who are genuinely that thing. Goes for life. Goes for D&D. Goes for JavaScript as well.

There is certainly a whole debate about the merits of OOP. I am way too much of a newb to weigh in on that. It may be awesome sauce for C++ and Java and C#. But I think it should be a settled issue that it's not awesome sauce for JavaScript.

It's not you, OOP. It's JavaScript...
