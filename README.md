## Credit Where Credit is Due

As these notes mature and grow, I'll add my own thoughts and spin on them. But the amazing online teachers who have laid this foundation deserve all the credit I can give them.

### Tony Alicea

If you haven't watched **JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts**, you're doing yourself a diservice. 

That Udemy course is like the goldilocks between an overly simplistic JavaScript tutorial and Kyle Simpson's **You Don't Know JavaScript** series.

Maybe learn some really basic syntax first and then dive into his course. Tony will equip you with the essential knowledhe you'll need to learn just about everything else in the world of JavaScript programming.

### Stephen Grider

Not the deep dive that Tony Alicea or Kyle Simpson provide, but I don't think that's the point of Stephen's Udemy courses. If programming is learning by doing, Stephen does an excellent job at teaching by doing. Instead of spending a lot of time explaining promises or generators or anything else, he creates easy to understand examples that show how these things work.
