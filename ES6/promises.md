# Promises!!!
* Yay!!!!
* Promises have been around for years!
  * But with ES6, they are now natively in JavaScript
  
## Terminology
* Promises exist in three possible states:
  * **unresolved**: where the Promise is waiting for something to finish
  * **resolved**: where that something finished and all went well
  * **rejected**: where that something finished and something went wrong
* The callback you use for **resolved** is `.then`
* The callback you use for **rejected** is `.catch`
*
